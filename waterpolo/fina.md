WP 15.3 A goal may be scored by any part of the body except the clenched fist. A goal may be scored by dribbling the ball into the goal. 

A goal may be scored by a player immediately shooting from outside 6 metres after the player’s team has been awarded a free throw for a foul committed outside- 6 metres. If the player puts the ball into play, a goal can be scored after faking (simulating a shot) or swimming with the ball. 

After a corner throw or goal throw is awarded and the player puts the ball into play, a goal can be scored after faking (simulating a shot) or swimming with the ball. 

 A goal can be scored by: 

* (a) a penalty throw;
* (b) a free throw thrown by a player into the player’s own goal;
* (c) an immediate shot from a goal throw;
* (d) an immediate shot from a free throw awarded outside 6 metres; or
* (e) a free throw taken and awarded outside 6 metres when the player has visibly
* (f) an immediate shot from a corner throw;
* (g) after awarding a free throw inside the 6 metre area, when at least two players put the ball into play. (of either team but excluding the defending goalkeeper) intentionally play or touch the ball

AQUATICS 

A goal may not be scored under this Rule by a direct shot from the restart following: 

* (a) a swim up or the commencement of a period
* (b) a timeout
* (c) a goal
* (d) an injury, including bleeding
* (e) the replacement of a cap
* (f) the referee calling for the ball or calling for a neutral throw
* (g) the ball leaving the side of the field of play
* (h) any other delay

However, after one of these situations (a) – (h), when the ball is visibly put into play outside the 6 m. area, the player is allowed to shoot, to shoot after faking (simulating a shot) or to swim with the ball and shoot. 

WP 15.4 A goal shall be scored if, at the expiration of 20 or 30 seconds possession, as applicable, or at the end of a period, the ball is in flight and enters the goal. 

 [NOTE: In the circumstances of this Rule, if the ball enters the goal after hitting the goal post, crossbar, goalkeeper or other defending player, and/or bouncing off the water, a goal shall be allowed. If the end of the period has been signalled and the ball is then played or touched intentionally by another attacking player on its way into the goal, the goal shall not be allowed. 

If the ball is in flight towards the goal in the circumstances of this Rule and the goalkeeper or another defending player pulls down the goal, or within his own 6 metre area a defending player other than the goalkeeper stops the ball with two hands or arms or punches the ball to prevent a goal being scored, the referee shall award a penalty throw if, in the referee’s opinion, the ball would have reached the goal line if the offence had not occurred. 

If the ball which is in flight towards the goal in the circumstances of this Rule lands on the water and then floats completely over the goal line, the referee shall award a goal only if the ball floats over the goal line immediately due to the momentum of the shot.] 

### WP 16 RESTARTING AFTER A GOAL 

WP 16.1 After a goal has been scored, the players shall take up positions anywhere within their respective halves of the field of play. No part of a player’s body shall be beyond the half distance line at water level. A referee shall restart the game by blowing the whistle. At the time of the restart, actual play shall resume when the ball leaves the hand of a player of the team not having scored the goal. A restart not taken in accordance with this Rule shall be retaken. 

### WP 17 GOAL THROWS 

WP 17.1 A goal throw shall be awarded: 

* (a) when the entire ball has passed fully over the goal line excluding between the
* (b) when the entire ball has passed fully over the goal line between the goal posts goal posts and underneath the crossbar, having last been touched by any player other than the goalkeeper of the defending team; and underneath the crossbar, or strikes the goal posts, crossbar or the defending goalkeeper direct from: AQUATICS 


	+ (i) a free throw awarded inside 6 metres;
	+ (ii) a free throw awarded outside 6 metres not taken in accordance with the Rules;
	+ (iii) a goal by the opposite team not taken in accordance with the Rules.However, if in one of these before mentioned situations, after a shot the ball rebounds into the field of play outside of the 2 metre area, in this specific situation, WP 20.1 is to be applied and the ball must be put in play at the location of the ball 

WP 17.2 The goal throw shall be taken by any player of the team from anywhere within the 2 metre area. A goal throw not taken in accordance with this Rule shall be retaken. 

[NOTE: The goal throw shall be taken by the player nearest to the ball. There should be no undue delay in taking a free throw, goal throw or corner throw, which must be taken in such a manner so as to enable the other players to observe the ball leaving the thrower’s hand. Players often make the mistake of delaying the throw because they overlook the provisions of WP 20.4, which permit the thrower to dribble the ball before passing to another player. The throw can thus be taken immediately, even though the thrower cannot at that moment find a player to whom to pass the ball. On such an occasion, the player is allowed to take the throw either by dropping it from a raised hand on to the surface of the water (figure 1) or by throwing it in the air (figure 2) and then swim with or dribble the ball. In either case, the throw must be taken so that the other players are able to observe it. 

When there is a counter attack, a player with advantage does not have to give up the advantage to go to the ball and take the free throw, goal throw or corner throw. Another player of that team can take the throw as long as there is no undue delay

### WP 18 CORNER THROWS 

WP 18.1 A corner throw shall be awarded when the entire ball has passed fully over the goal line excluding between the goal posts and underneath the crossbar, having last been touched by the goalkeeper of the defending team or when a defending player deliberately sends the ball over the goal line. 

WP 18.2 The corner throw shall be taken by a player of the attacking team from the 2 metre mark on the side nearest to which the ball crossed the goal line. The throw need not be taken by the nearest player but shall be taken without undue delay. 

 [NOTE: For method of taking the throw, see note to WP 17.2] 

WP 18.3 At the taking a corner throw no players of the attacking team shall be within the 2 metre area. 

AQUATICS 

WP 18.4 A corner throw taken from the wrong position or before the players of the attacking team have left the 2 metre area shall be retaken. 

### WP 19 NEUTRAL THROWS 

WP 19.1 A neutral throw shall be awarded: 

* (a) when, at the start of a period, a referee is of the opinion that the ball has fallen
* (b) when one or more players of opposing teams commit an ordinary foul at the
* (c) when both referees blow their whistles at the same moment to award ordinary
* (d) when neither team has possession of the ball and one or more players of
* (e) when the ball strikes or lodges in an overhead obstruction. in a position to the definite advantage of one team; same moment which makes it impossible for the referees to distinguish which player offended first; fouls to the opposing teams; opposing teams commit an exclusion foul at the same moment. The neutral throw shall be taken after the offending players have been excluded;

WP 19.2 At a neutral throw, a referee shall throw the ball into the field of play at approximately the same lateral position as the event occurred in such a manner as to allow the players of both teams to have equal opportunity to reach the ball. A neutral throw awarded within the 2 metre area shall be taken on the 2 metre line. 

WP 19.3 If at a neutral throw the referee is of the opinion that the ball has fallen in a position to the definite advantage of one team, the referee shall call for the ball and retake the throw. 

### WP 20 FREE THROWS 

WP 20.1 A free throw shall be taken at the location of the ball, except if the foul is committed by a defending player within the defender’s goal area and the ball is inside the goal area, the free throw shall be taken on the 2 metre line opposite to the location of the ball. If the ball is outside of the goal area at the moment that the foul is awarded, the free throw shall be taken from the location of the ball. 

WP 20.2 A player awarded a free throw shall put the ball into play immediately, including by passing or by shooting, if permitted by the Rules. It shall be an offence if a player who is clearly in a position most readily to take a free throw does not do so. A defending player having committed a foul shall move away from the player taking the free throw before raising an arm to block a pass or shot; a player who fails to do so shall be excluded for “interference” under WP 22.5. 

WP 20.3 The responsibility for returning the ball to the player who is to take the free throw shall be that of the team to which the free throw is awarded. 

WP 20.4 The free throw shall be taken in a manner to enable the players to observe the ball leaving the hand of the player taking the throw, who shall also then be permitted to carry or dribble the ball before passing to another player, or to shoot, when permitted. The ball shall be in play immediately when it leaves the hand of the player taking the free throw. 

[NOTE: For method of taking the throw, see note to WP 17.2.] 

### WP 21 ORDINARY FOULS 

AQUATICS 

WP 21.1 It shall be an ordinary foul to commit any of the following offences (WP 21.2 to WP 21.17), which shall be punished by awarding of a free throw to the opposing team. 

 [NOTE: The referees must award ordinary fouls in accordance with the Rules to enable the attacking team to develop an advantage situation. However, the referees must have regard to the special circumstance of WP 7.3 (Advantage).] 

WP 21.2 To advance beyond the goal line at the start of a period, before the referee has given the signal to start. The free throw shall be taken from the location of the ball or, if the ball has not been released into the field of play, from the half distance line. 

WP 21.3 To assist a player at the start of a period or at any other time during the game. 

WP 21.4 To hold or push off from the goal posts or their fixtures, to hold or push off from the sides or ends of the pool during actual play or at the start of a period. 

WP 21.5 To take any active part in the game when standing on the floor of the pool, to walk when play is in progress or to jump from the floor of the pool to play the ball or tackle an opponent. This Rule shall not apply to the goalkeeper while within the goalkeeper’s 6 metre area. 

WP 21.6 . To take or hold the entire ball under the water when tackled, or to deliberately hide it from the opposing team. 

[NOTE: It is an ordinary foul to take or hold the ball under the water when tackled, even if the player holding the ball has the ball forced under the water as a result of the opponent’s challenge (figure 3). It makes no difference that the ball goes under the water against the player’s will. What is important is that the foul is awarded against the player who was in contact with the ball at the moment it was taken under the water. It is important to remember that the offence can only occur when a player takes the ball under when tackled. Thus, if the goalkeeper emerges high out of the water to save a shot and then while falling back takes the ball under the water, the goalkeeper has committed no offence; but if the goalkeeper then holds the ball under the water when challenged by an opponent, the goalkeeper will have committed an infringement of this Rule and if the goalkeeper’s actions prevented a probable goal, a penalty throw must be awarded under WP 23.2.] 

Figure 3 

\ 

WP 21.7 To strike at the ball with a clenched fist. This Rule shall not apply to the goalkeeper while within the goalkeeper’s 6 metre area. 

WP 21.8 To play or touch the ball with two hands at the same time. This Rule shall not apply to the goalkeeper while within the goalkeeper’s 6 metre area. 

WP 21.9 To push or push off from an opponent who is not holding the ball. 

AQUATICS 

[NOTE: Pushing can take place in various forms, including with the hand (figure 4) or with the foot (figure 5). In the cases illustrated, the punishment is a free throw for an ordinary foul. However, referees must take care to differentiate between pushing with the foot and kicking - which then becomes an exclusion foul or even violent action. If the foot is already in contact with the opponent when the movement begins, this will usually be pushing, but if the movement begins before such contact with the opponent is made, then this should generally be regarded as kicking.] 

Figure 4 Figure 5

| 

WP 21.10 To be within the goal area except when behind the line of the ball. 

The goal area is a rectangular box extending to 2 metres from the lateral outsides of the goal posts to the 2 metre line opposite the goal line. 

It shall not be an offence if a player is inside the 2 metre line but outside the goal area. 

Any player who is behind the line of the ball can enter the goal area to receive the ball. 

Any player inside the goal area who does not shoot but passes the ball backwards has to leave the goal area immediately to avoid being sanctioned under this rule. 

WP 21.11 To take a penalty throw other than in the prescribed manner. 

[NOTE: See WP 24.4 for method of taking a penalty throw.] 

WP 21.12 To delay unduly when taking a free throw, goal throw or corner throw. 

[NOTE: See note to WP 17.2] 

WP 21.13 To last touch the ball that goes out of the side of the field of play (including the ball rebounding from the side of the field of play) except in the case of a defensive field player blocking a shot over the side of the field of play, in which case a free throw is given to the defensive team. 

WP 21.14 For a team to retain possession of the ball for more than: 

* (i) 30 seconds of actual play, or
* (ii) 20 seconds in the case of an exclusion, corner throw or rebound to the attacking team after a shot, including after a penalty shot, without shooting at the opponent’s goal.

The timekeeper recording the possession time shall reset the clock: 

* (a) when the ball has left the hand of the player shooting at goal. If the ball rebounds into play from the goal post, crossbar or the goalkeeper, the possession time shall not recommence until the ball comes into the possession of one of the teams. The clock shall be reset to 20 seconds if the ball comes into possession of the attacking team. It shall be reset to 30 seconds if it comes into possession of the defending team; AQUATICS
* (b) when the ball comes into the possession of the defending team, the clock shall
* (c) when the ball is put into play following the award of an exclusion foul to the
* (d) when the ball is put into play following the taking of a penalty throw without a
* (e) when the ball is put into play following the award of a penalty throw with a be reset to 30 seconds. “Possession” shall not include the ball merely being touched in flight by an opposing player; defending player, the clock shall be reset to 20 seconds unless there are more than 20 seconds of possession time remaining, in which case the time shall continue and not be reset; change of possession or, corner throw, the clock shall be reset to 20 seconds; change of possession, a goal throw or neutral throw, the clock shall be reset to 30 seconds.

Visible clocks shall show the time in a descending manner (that is, showing the possession time remaining). 

[NOTE: The timekeeper and referees must decide whether there was a shot on goal or not but the referees have the final decision.] 

WP 21.16 To waste time. 

[NOTE: It is always permissible for a referee to award an ordinary foul under this Rule before the applicable possession period has elapsed. 

In the last minute of the game, the referees must be certain that there is intentional wasting time before applying this Rule 

If the goalkeeper or any other player is the only player of the team in that team’s half of the field of play, it shall be deemed wasting time for the goalkeeper or player to receive the ball from another member of that team who is in the other half of the field of play. 

WP 21.17 To simulate being fouled. 

[NOTE: Simulation means an action taken by a player with the apparent intent of causing a referee to award a foul incorrectly against an opposing player. A referee may issue a yellow card against a team for repeated simulation and may apply WP 22.13 (persistent fouling) to sanction offending players.] 

WP 21.18 (NEW) To go under the water to gain positional advantage 

### WP 22 EXCLUSION FOULS 

WP 22.1 It shall be an exclusion foul to commit any of the following offences (WP 22.4 to WP 22.18) which shall be punished (except as otherwise provided by the Rules) by the award of a free throw to the opposing team and the exclusion of the player who committed the foul. 

WP 22.2 The excluded player shall move to the re-entry area nearest to the player’s own goal line without leaving the water. An excluded player who leaves the water (other than following the entry of a substitute) shall be deemed guilty of an offence under WP 22.13 (Misconduct). 

 [NOTE: An excluded player (including any player excluded under the Rules for the remainder of the game) shall remain in the water and move (which may include swimming underwater) to the re-entry position nearest to the player’s own goal line without interfering with the play. The player may leave from the field of play at any point and then swim to reach the re-entry area provided the player does not interfere with the alignment of the goal. 

AQUATICS 

On reaching the re-entry area, the excluded player shall be required to visibly rise to the surface of the water and touch hands above the water with the substitute, if applicable, before the player shall be permitted to re-enter in accordance with the Rules. 

WP 22.3 The excluded player or a substitute shall be permitted to re-enter the field of play from the exclusion re-entry area nearest to the player’s own goal line after the earliest occurrence of one of the following: 

* (a) when 20 seconds of actual play have elapsed, at which time the secretary shall
* (b) when a goal has been scored;
* (c) when the excluded player’s team has retaken possession of the ball (which
* (d) when the excluded player’s team is awarded a free throw or goal throw, the raise the appropriate flag provided that the excluded player has reached the re- entry area in accordance with the Rules; means receiving control of the ball) during actual play, at which time the defensive referee shall signal re-entry by a hand signal; referee’s signal to award the throw qualifies as the re-entry signal, provided that the excluded player has reached the re-entry area in accordance with the Rules.

The excluded player or a substitute shall be permitted to re-enter the field of play from the exclusion re-entry area nearest to the player’s own goal line, provided that: 

* (a) the player has received a signal from the secretary or a referee;
* (b) the player shall not jump or push off from the side or wall of the pool or field of
* (c) the player shall not affect the alignment of the goal;
* (d) a substitute shall not be permitted to enter in the place of an excluded player
* (e) after a goal has been scored, an excluded player or a substitute may re-enter play; until that player has reached the exclusion re-entry area nearest to the player’s own goal line except between periods, after a goal, or during a timeout; the field of play from any place.

These provisions shall also apply to the entry of a substitute when the excluded player has received three personal fouls or has otherwise been excluded from the remainder of the game in accordance with the Rules. 

[NOTE: A substitute shall not be signalled in by a referee and nor shall the secretary signal the expiration of 20 seconds exclusion period until the excluded player has reached the re-entry area nearest to the player’s own goal line. This shall also apply to the re-entry of a substitute who is to replace a player excluded from the remainder of the game. In the event of an excluded player failing to return to the player’s re-entry area, a substitute shall not be permitted to enter until a goal has been scored or at the end of a period or during a timeout. 

The primary responsibility for giving the signal for the re-entry of an excluded player or a substitute is with the defensive referee. However, the attacking referee may also assist in this regard and the signal of either referee shall be valid. If a referee suspects an improper re-entry or the goal judge signals such an improper re-entry, then the referee should first be satisfied that the other referee had not signalled the re-entry. 

Before giving the signal for the re-entry of an excluded player or a substitute, the defensive referee should wait momentarily in case the attacking referee whistles to restore possession to the opponent’s team. 

AQUATICS 

A change of possession does not occur merely because of the end of a period, but an excluded player or substitute shall be eligible to re-enter if the team wins the ball at the swim up at the start of the next period. If a player is excluded when the end of a period is signalled, the referees and the secretary shall ensure that the teams have the correct number of players before signalling for the restart.] 

WP 22.4 For a player to leave the water or sit or stand on the steps or side of the pool during play, except in the case of accident, injury, illness or with the permission of a referee. 

WP 22.5 To interfere with the taking of a free throw, goal throw or corner throw, including: 

* (a) intentionally to throw away or fail to release the ball to prevent the normal progress of the game;
* (b) any attempt to play the ball before it has left the hand of the thrower.

[NOTE: A player is not to be penalised under this Rule if the player does not hear the whistle as a result of being under the water. The referees must determine if the actions of the player are intentional. 

Interference with a throw may take place indirectly when the ball is hampered, delayed or prevented from reaching the player who is to take the throw, or it may occur when the execution of the throw is interfered with by an opponent blocking the direction of the throw (figure 6), by disturbing the actual movement of the thrower (figure 7) or by an opponent committing a foul under WP 20.2. For interference with a penalty throw, see also WP 22.17.] 

Figure 6 Figure 7 

WP 22.6 To attempt to block a pass or shot with two hands outside the 6 metre area. 

WP 22.7 To splash in the face of an opponent intentionally. 

[NOTE: Splashing is frequently used as an unfair tactic but is often only penalised in the obvious situation when players are facing one another (see figure 8). However, it can also occur less obviously when a player produces a curtain of water with an arm, seemingly without deliberate intent, in an attempt to block the view of the opponent who is about to shoot at goal or to make a pass. 

AQUATICS 

Figure 8 

The punishment for intentionally splashing an opponent is exclusion under WP 22.7 or a penalty throw under WP 23.2 if the opponent is inside the 6 metre area and is attempting to shoot at goal. Whether to award a penalty throw or an exclusion is decided solely by the positioning and actions of the attacking player; whether the offending player is inside the 6 metre area or outside is not a decisive factor.] 

WP 22.8 To impede or otherwise prevent the Figure 9 

free movement of an opponent who is not holding the ball, including swimming on the opponent’s shoulders, back or legs. “Holding” is lifting, carrying or touching the ball but does not include dribbling the ball. 

[NOTE: This Rule can also be applied to advantage the attacking team. If a counter attack is in progress and a foul is committed which limits the attack, the offending player shall be excluded. 

The first thing for the referee to consider is whether the opponent is holding the ball, because if the player is doing so, the player making the challenge cannot be penalised for “impeding”. It is clear that a player is holding the ball if it is held raised above the water (figure 9). The player is also holding the ball if the player swims with it held in the hand or makes contact with the ball while it is lying on 

the surface of the water (figure 10). Swimming with the ball (dribbling), as shown in figure 11, is not considered to be holding. 

Figure 10 

Figure 11 

AQUATICS 

A common form of impeding is where the player swims across the opponent’s legs (figure 12), thus reducing the pace at which the opponent can move and interfering with the normal leg action. Another form is swimming on the opponent’s shoulders. It must also be remembered that the foul of impeding can be committed by the player who is in possession of the ball. For example, figure 13 shows a player keeping one hand on the ball and trying to force the opponent away to gain more space. Figure 14 shows a player in possession of the ball impeding the opponent by pushing the opponent back with the head. Care must be taken with figures 13 & 14, because any violent movement by the player in possession of the ball might constitute striking or even violent action ; the figures are intended to illustrate impeding without any violent movement. A player may also commit the offence of impeding even if the player is not holding or touching the ball. Figure 15 shows a player intentionally blocking the opponent with the player’s body and with the arms flung open, thus making access to the ball impossible. This offence is most often committed near the boundaries of the field of play.]

AQUATICS 

WP 22.9 To hold, sink or pull back an opponent who is not holding the ball. “Holding” is lifting, carrying or touching the ball, but does not include dribbling the ball. 

[NOTE: The correct application of this Rule is very important both as to the presentation of the game and in arriving at a proper and fair result. The wording of the Rule is clear and explicit and can only be interpreted in one way: to hold (figure 16), sink (figure 17) or pull back (figure 18) an opponent who is not holding the ball is an exclusion foul. It is essential that referees apply this Rule correctly, without personal arbitrary interpretation, to ensure that the proper limits to rough play are not exceeded. In addition, referees must note that an infringement of WP 22.9 within the 6 metre area which prevents a probable goal must be punished by the award of a penalty throw.]

WP 22.10 To use two hands to hold an opponent not holding the ball anywhere in the field of play. 

WP 22.11 For a defending player to commit a foul on any player of the team in possession of the ball with the intent to stop the flow of the attack, anywhere in the field of play. This kind of foul is called a tactical foul 

WP 22.12 To kick or strike an opponent intentionally or make disproportionate movements with that intent. 

 [NOTE: The offence of kicking or striking can take a number of different forms, including being committed by a player in possession of the ball or by an opposing player; possession of the ball is not a decisive factor. What is important is the action of the offending player, including if the player makes disproportionate movements in an attempt to kick or strike, even if the player fails to make contact. 

AQUATICS 

One of the most serious acts of striking is elbowing backwards (figure 19), which can result in serious injury to the opponent. Similarly, serious injury can occur when a player intentionally heads back into the face of an opponent who is marking the player closely. In these circumstances, the referee would also be justified in punishing the offence under WP 22.14 (Violent Actions) rather than under WP 22.12] 

Figure 19

WP 22.13 To be guilty of misconduct, including the use of unacceptable language, aggressive or persistent foul play, to refuse obedience to or show disrespect for a referee or official, or behaviour against the spirit of the Rules and likely to bring the game into disrepute. The offending player shall be excluded from the remainder of the game, with substitution after the earliest occurrence referred to in WP 22.3, and must leave the competition area. 

 [NOTE: If a player commits any offence mentioned in this rule during the interval between periods, during a timeout, or after a goal, the player shall be excluded for the remainder of the game and a substitute shall be eligible to re-enter immediately prior to the restart of the game as all these situations are considered to be interval time. Play will restart in the normal manner.] 

WP 22.14 To commit a violent action (including to play in a violent manner, kicking, striking or attempting to kick or strike with malicious intent) against an opponent or official, whether during actual play, during any stoppages, timeouts, after a goal has been scored or during intervals between periods of play. 

Should this occur during the game the offending player shall be excluded from the remainder of the game and must leave the competition area and a penalty throw awarded to the opposing team. The offending player may be substituted when four minutes of actual play have elapsed. 

Should the incident occur during any stoppage, timeout, after a goal or interval between periods of play, the player shall be excluded for the remainder of a game and must leave the competition area. No penalty throw shall be awarded. The offending player may be substituted when four minutes of actual play have elapsed and play will restart in the normal manner. 

If the referees call simultaneous violent actions or actions of play in a violent manner on players of opposing teams during play, both players are excluded for the remainder of the game with substitution after four minutes of actual play have elapsed. The team, which had possession of the ball, will first shoot a penalty throw followed by the other team shooting a penalty throw. After the second penalty throw, the team, which had possession of the ball, will restart play with a free throw on or behind the half distance line. 

AQUATICS 

WP 22.15 In the case of simultaneous exclusion of players of opposing teams during play, both players are excluded for 20 seconds. The possession clock is not reset. Play is restarted with a free throw to the team which had possession of the ball. If neither team had possession when the simultaneous exclusions were called, the possession clock is reset to 30 seconds and play shall be restarted with a neutral throw. 

 [NOTE: Both players excluded under this Rule, shall be permitted to re-enter at the next earliest occurrence referred to in WP 22.3 or at the next change of possession. 

If two players have been excluded under this Rule and are eligible to re-enter, the defensive referee may wave in the player as soon as that player is ready to re-enter. The referee does not have to wait until both players are ready to re-enter.] 

WP 22.16 For an excluded player to re-enter or a substitute to enter the field of play improperly, including: 

* (a) without having received a signal from the secretary or referee;
* (b) from any place other than the player’s exclusion re-entry area, except where
* (c) by jumping or pushing off from the side or wall of the pool or field of play;
* (d) by affecting the alignment of the goal.
* (e) for a flying substitute to enter the field of play not following the correct flying the Rules provide for immediate substitution; substitution procedure as mentioned in WP 5.6 and WP 5.6.1

If this offence is committed by a player of the team not in possession of the ball, the offending player shall be excluded and a penalty throw awarded to the opposing team. This player receives only one personal foul, which should be marked by the secretary as exclusion penalty. 

If this offence is committed by a player of the team in possession of the ball, the offending player shall be excluded and a free throw awarded to the opposing team. 

WP 22.17 To interfere with the taking of a penalty throw after the whistle by the referee. The offending player shall be excluded from the remainder of the game with substitution after the earliest occurrence referred to in WP 22.3 and the penalty throw shall be maintained or re-taken as appropriate. The referees may use the VAR system to determine if there has been interference with the penalty throw 

[NOTE: The most common form of interference with a penalty throw is when an opponent aims a kick at the player taking the throw, just as the throw is about to be taken. It is essential for the referees to ensure that all players are at least 3 metres from the thrower and outside of the 6 metre area, to prevent such interference taking place. The referee should also allow the defending team the first right to take position.] 

WP 22.18 For the defending goalkeeper to fail to take up the correct position on the goal line at the taking of a penalty throw having been ordered once to do so by the referee. Another defending player may take the position of the goalkeeper but without the goalkeeper’s privileges or limitations. 

WP 22.19 When a player is excluded, the exclusion period shall commence immediately when the ball has left the hand of the player taking the free throw or when the ball has been touched following a neutral throw. 

AQUATICS 

WP 22.20 If an excluded player intentionally interferes with play, including affecting the alignment of the goal, a penalty throw shall be awarded to the opposing team and a further personal foul awarded against the excluded player. If the excluded player does not commence leaving the field of play almost immediately, the referee may deem this to be intentional interference under this Rule. 

### WP 23 PENALTY FOULS 

WP 23.1 It shall be a penalty foul to commit any of the following offences (WP 23.2 to WP 23.9), which shall be punished by the award of a penalty throw to the opposing team. 

WP 23.2 For a defending player to commit any foul within the 6 metre area if a goal would probably have resulted. 

[NOTE: In addition to other offences preventing a probable goal, it is an offence within the meaning of this Rule: 

* (a) for a goalkeeper or other defending player to pull down or otherwise displace
* (b) for a defending player to attempt to block a shot or pass with two hands (figure
* (c) for a defending player to play the ball with a clenched fist (figure 22);
* (d) for a goalkeeper or other defending player to hold the ball under the water when the goal (figure 20); 21); tackled.

The referee can delay whistling and wait to see if the attacking player scores a goal in the same action. If the player does not score, the referee should sanction the penalty. The referee may raise an arm indicating a possible penalty. 

It is important to note that while the fouls described above, and other fouls such as holding, pulling back, impeding, etc., would normally be punished by a free throw (and exclusion if appropriate), they become penalty fouls if committed within the 6 metre area by a defending player if a probable goal would otherwise have been scored.]

AQUATICS 

Figure 22 

WP 23.3 For a defending player within the 6 metre area to kick or strike an opponent or commit a violent action.

No personal foul shall be recorded for this offence for the coach or any team official. 

WP 23.9 For a defending player to impede an attacking player from behind within the 6 metre area when the attacking player is facing the goal and making a shooting action, unless the defending player makes contact only with the ball. If the defending player’s foul, described in this rule prevents the attacking player from scoring , a penalty must also be called. The referee must delay the call of penalty until the shot or attempted shot is completed 

[NOTE: The referees must award a penalty unless the attacking player scores.] 

WP 23.10 If, in the last minute of the game, a penalty throw is awarded to a team, the coach may elect to maintain possession of the ball and be awarded a free throw. The timekeeper recording possession time shall reset the clock to 30 seconds, and the game will be restarted as after a time-out.

The defending goalkeeper shall be positioned between the goal posts with no part of his body beyond the goal line at water level. The referees can give one warning to the players or the goalkeeper to take up the correct position. If that person does not do so, the player or goalkeeper shall be excluded and shall reenter in accordance with WP22.3. Should the goalkeeper be out of the water, another player may take the position of the goalkeeper but without the goalkeeper’s privileges and limitations. The referees may use the VAR system to determine if there has been interference with the penalty throw. 

WP 24.3 When the referee controlling the taking of the throw is satisfied that the players are in their correct positions the referee shall signal for the throw to be taken, by whistle and by simultaneously lowering the arm from a vertical to a horizontal position. 

 [NOTE: The lowering of the arm at the same time as the signal by whistle makes it possible under any conditions, even amidst noise by spectators, to execute the throw in accordance with the Rules. As the arm is lifted, the player taking the throw will concentrate, for the player knows that the signal will follow immediately.] 

WP 24.4 The player taking the penalty throw shall have possession of the ball and shall immediately throw it with an uninterrupted movement directly at the goal. The player may take the throw by lifting the ball from the water (figure 23) or with the ball held in the raised hand (figure 24) and the ball may be taken backwards from the direction of the goal in preparation for the forward throw, provided that the continuity of the movement shall not be interrupted before the ball leaves the thrower’s hand.
